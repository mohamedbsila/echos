## ðŸš€ How to Use

### Automatic Initialization
All components initialize automatically on mobile/tablet devices (â‰¤1024px width).

### Manual Control
```javascript
// Access individual components
const navbar = window.EnhancedMobileNav.getInstance();
const musicControls = window.EnhancedMusicControls.getInstance();
const loader = window.Creative3DLoader.getInstance();
const performance = window.MobilePerformanceOptimizer.getInstance();

// Force refresh all components
window.MobileEnhancementsIntegration.forceRefresh();
```

### Configuration
```javascript
// Set performance level manually
window.MobilePerformanceOptimizer.forceOptimization('low');

// Update music track info
const musicControls = window.EnhancedMusicControls.getInstance();
musicControls.setTrack({
    title: "New Track",
    artist: "ECHOS",
    duration: 240
});
```
